With numpy, it is very easy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays. **You can add, subtract, multiply and divide** arrays, just like you would with regular numbers.

    "Numpy provides a convenient and powerful way to perform data analysis tasks on **large datasets**. One of the most common tasks in data analysis is finding the **mean, median, and standard deviation** of a dataset. Numpy provides functions to perform these operations quickly and easily. The mean function calculates the average value of the data, while the median function calculates the middle value in the data. The standard deviation function calculates how spread out the data is from the mean. Additionally, numpy provides functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the data. These functions are very useful for gaining insight into the properties of large datasets and can be used for a wide range of data analysis tasks."
