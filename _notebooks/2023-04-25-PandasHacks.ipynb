    "# Predictive Analysis\n",
    "Predictive analysis is the use of **statistical**, data mining, and machine learning techniques to analyze current and historical data in order to make predictions about future events or behaviors. It involves identifying **patterns** and trends in data, and then using that information to forecast what is likely to happen in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analysis is used in a wide range of applications, from forecasting sales and demand, to predicting customer behavior, to detecting fraudulent transactions. It involves collecting and analyzing data from a variety of sources, including historical data, customer data, financial data, and social media data, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of predictive analysis typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. Defining the problem and identifying the relevant data sources\n",
    "2. **Collecting and cleaning the data**\n",
    "3. Exploring and analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends\n",
    "4. Selecting an appropriate model or algorithm to use for predictions\n",
    "5. Training and validating the model using historical data\n",
    "6. **Using the model to make predictions on new data**\n",
    "7. Monitoring and evaluating the performance of the model over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analysis can help organizations make more informed decisions, improve efficiency, and gain a competitive advantage by leveraging insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is most commonly used in **Retail**, where workers try to predict which products would be most popular and try to advertise those products as much as possible, and also **Healthcare**, where algorithms analyze patterns and reveal prerequisites for diseases and suggest preventive treatment, predict the results of various treatments and choose the best option for each patient individually, and predict disease outbreaks and epidemics."

    "### What is Pandas\n",
    "Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. A python library is something  It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Pandas?\n",
    "Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories. Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.Also it is a part of data analysis, and data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Can Pandas Do?\n",
    "Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:\n",
    "- Is there a correlation between two or more columns?\n",
    "- What is average value\n",
    "- Max value\n",
    "- Min value\n",
    "- How to load data \n",
    "- Delete data \n",
    "- Sort Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data."
