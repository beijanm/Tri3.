            "content": "Predictive Analysis . Predictive analysis is the use of statistical, data mining, and machine learning techniques to analyze current and historical data in order to make predictions about future events or behaviors. It involves identifying patterns and trends in data, and then using that information to forecast what is likely to happen in the future. . Predictive analysis is used in a wide range of applications, from forecasting sales and demand, to predicting customer behavior, to detecting fraudulent transactions. It involves collecting and analyzing data from a variety of sources, including historical data, customer data, financial data, and social media data, among others. . The process of predictive analysis typically involves the following steps: . Defining the problem and identifying the relevant data sources | Collecting and cleaning the data | Exploring and analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends | Selecting an appropriate model or algorithm to use for predictions | Training and validating the model using historical data | Using the model to make predictions on new data | Monitoring and evaluating the performance of the model over time | Predictive analysis can help organizations make more informed decisions, improve efficiency, and gain a competitive advantage by leveraging insights from data. . It is most commonly used in Retail, where workers try to predict which products would be most popular and try to advertise those products as much as possible, and also Healthcare, where algorithms analyze patterns and reveal prerequisites for diseases and suggest preventive treatment, predict the results of various treatments and choose the best option for each patient individually, and predict disease outbreaks and epidemics. . Pandas . Pandas is an open-source data analysis and manipulation library for the Python programming language. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for working with structured data such as tabular, time-series, and matrix data. . Pandas offers two main data structures: Series and DataFrame. A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and Python objects. A DataFrame is a two-dimensional table-like data structure consisting of rows and columns with labeled axes. It is the primary data structure used in Pandas and is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. . Pandas provides a wide range of functionality for data analysis tasks such as data cleaning, filtering, transformation, merging, aggregation, and visualization. It also offers tools for handling missing or incomplete data, time-series analysis, and integration with other data analysis libraries in Python such as NumPy. . import pandas as pd # reads the JSON file and converts it to a Pandas DataFrame df = pd.read_json(&#39;files/menu.json&#39;) print(df) . print(df[[&#39;Item ID&#39;]]) print() #try two columns and remove the index from print statement print(df[[&#39;Price&#39;,&#39;Item ID&#39;]].to_string(index=False)) . print(df.sort_values(by=[&#39;Item ID&#39;])) print() #sort the values in reverse order print(df.sort_values(by=[&#39;Item ID&#39;], ascending=False)) . print(df[df.Price &gt; 1.49]) . print(df[df.Price == df.Price.max()]) print() print(df[df.Price == df.Price.min()]) . Hacks . Answer the questions below and write code for the last question. Some questions may require individual research. . What are the key data structures used in Pandas? ? | . | How can you merge, join, and concatenate data frames in Pandas? ? | . | How can you optimize the performance of Pandas operations on large datasets? ? | . | Find a certain scenario, topic, or trend which has quantitative data.

From Pandas Overview -- When working with tabular data, such as data stored in spreadsheets or databases, pandas is the right tool for you. pandas will help you to explore, clean, and process your data. In pandas, a data table is called a DataFrame. | . . &#39;&#39;&#39;Pandas is used to gather data sets through its DataFrames implementation&#39;&#39;&#39; import pandas as pd . Cleaning Data . When looking at a data set, check to see what data needs to be cleaned. Examples include: . Missing Data Points | Invalid Data | Inaccurate Data | . Run the following code to see what needs to be cleaned . df = pd.read_json(&#39;files/grade.json&#39;) print(df) # What part of the data set needs to be cleaned? # From PBL learning, what is a good time to clean data?

The result of &#39;Training&#39; data is making it easier to analyze or make conclusions. In looking at the Titanic, as you clean you would probably want to make assumptions on likely chance of survival. .

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? .

Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations.
